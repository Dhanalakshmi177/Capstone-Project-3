# BizCardX-Extracting Business Card Data with OCR
BizCardX is a simple Python application in that anyone can use to extract data from business cards. 
The main purpose of BizcardX is to automate the process of extracting key details from business card images such as the name, designation, company, contact information and other relevant data. By leveraging the power of OCR (Optical Character Recognition) provided by EasyOCR.
# Problen Statement
It is a Streamlit application that allows users to upload an image of a business card and extract relevant information from it using easyOCR.The extracted information should then be displayed in the application's
graphical user interface (GUI).
In addition, the application should allow users to save the extracted information into a database along with the uploaded business card image. The database should be able to store multiple entries, each with its own business card image and extracted information.
# Overview 
The simple and intuitive user interface in the application guides users through the process of uploading the business card image and extracting its information. The extracted information should
be displayed in a clean and organized manner, and users should be able to easily add it to the database with the click of a button. And Allow the user to Read the data, Update the data and Allow the user to delete the data through the streamlit GUI.
# Take Away Skills
The following skills were acquired from the project:
- PYTHON
- OPTICAL CHARACTER RECOGNITION (OCR)
- PANDAS
- MYSQL
- STREAMLIT GUI
# Work Flow
# User-Friendly Interface
The application boasts a simple and intuitive UI that guides users seamlessly through the process of uploading a business card image and extracting information.
# Data Extraction
The application extracts important data, such as the name of the business, the cardholder's name, their designation, their email address, their mobile number, the URL of their website, their area, city, state, 
and pin code, by using the easyOCR .
# DataBase Integration
Users can submit a photograph of their business card and store the extracted data in a database. Multiple entries, each with a corresponding business card image and extracted information, are intended to be 
stored in the database, which is powered by MySQL.
# CRUD Operations
Essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) actions are supported by the program. With the Streamlit UI, users can quickly add, view, change, and remove entries.

# Usage of App
After the project has been successfully set up and activated, users can interact with the Streamlit application through a web browser. Through the application's user-friendly interface, users can carry out the 
following tasks:

- Input a Business Card to fetch corresponding data from it .
- Gather respective information and keep it in a SQL data warehouse for numerous Business Cards.
- Check out the uploaded Bizcard Details do any modifications you can want to or delete some data which is not needed anymore.
# Method of use
Follow these steps,to use this project :

1 Set up the streamlit package : pip install streamlit

2.Run the Streamlit app: streamlit run app.py

3.The web browser will launch instantly, allowing you to access it.

4.Open your web browser if it doesn't start automatically. By starting a new tab and typing the following URL, you can visit it:http://localhost:8501

5.Click the store data button after uploading bizcard on the Data Extract tab.

6.Then database will hold the Business Card details.

7.In the Modify tab,Do modifications like edit or delete as per your need.

# Conclusion
The goal of this project is to create a simple and intuitive user interface using Streamlit that guides users through the process of uploading the business card image and extracting its information using easyOCR.And display it in a clean and organized manner in the Streamlit GUI , where you can do modifications too.
